# APCS
All projects from AP Computer Science A that I did, which covers OOP through Java.

In this folder, there are 19 modules (excluding a few, like 10 and 11, which had no projects in it).
Each module up to 15 neatly describes what the project is about in a couple words. At module 15 in my 
Senior year, it was half way through my last semester of High School and I was worried about things other
than naming conventions. What a prick!

Some of the module folders contain the documentation that I followed to complete the projects. The 
actual coding projects that I did are located in the Lesson folders in the earlier modules, under
the numbered assignments. Each numbered assignment file contains the files used to generate the code.
The IDE I used for this class was BlueJ.

In the future, I might neaten everything up and document it properly. Until then, you must suffer!
