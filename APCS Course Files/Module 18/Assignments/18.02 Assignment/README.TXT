VERSION or DATE: May 22nd, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use binary search

[+] Through the creation of this program, I had to do a bit of everything,
which made me really appreciate what I've learned so far.

[-] I can't seem to figure out how to reduce something in the program from
myMusic = insertionSort(myMusic) to insertionSort(myMusic)...
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to be able to implement even MORE searches than
just the two I've learned here. Also, how do I modify an array using a public
static void method?
