======================================PMR======================================
[+] Understand how to use PrintWriter and File objects

[+] Doing this project was an enjoyable challenge

[-] Had to rewrite the program multiple times to understand how it could work

[-] Had a few problems with writing the program; Usually, I just write
the program from start to finish, but this time I couldn't, because I had to
start from the inside loop to the outside loop and work from there to get it
to work properly.
===============================================================================
In the future, I won't just barf out the code without properly working through
it. I would like to know whether or not it would be possible to use the same
PrintWriter or File object to access the same information without using a
seperate one.
