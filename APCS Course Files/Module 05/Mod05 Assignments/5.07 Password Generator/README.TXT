==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Loops are fun

[+] Loops (while + for), random objects, and simulation creation are basically
mastered.

[+] The only thing I keep messing up are the semicolons 

[-] I decided to change the name of a variable (because why not), but it was
late in the program's creation, so I spent about 10 minutes rewriting variable
names.
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to create more "simulation" programs - maybe about
population deterioration, or perhaps a graphing calculator!
I finally figured out that working from the simplest part of the program and
branching out is how you should program in the first place. And only 3 months
in, too!
