AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Able to effectively use while loops

[+] Understand the useage of the Math.random() function

[-] Project seemed a little too simple, since there were examples that
only needed to be cut-and-pasted into new code
===============================================================================
In the future, it would be nice if I could make my own code from scratch without
examples for the entire project.
