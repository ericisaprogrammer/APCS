PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand how to read .txt files using java
VERSION or DATE: November 19th, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Properly understand the code required to read .txt files

[+] Writing the code was an enjoyable challenge

[-] Some of the code for I/O is somewhat confusing still
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see more projects like this, but with a little
more challenge in them, such as trying to combine two files or sort a file
or something like that.
