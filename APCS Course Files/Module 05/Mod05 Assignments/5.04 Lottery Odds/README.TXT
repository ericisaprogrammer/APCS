PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Demonstrate proper usage of loops (while, for)
VERSION or DATE: November 20th, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to implement for loops into programming

[+] Using both loop types is pretty easy, if you know what you're doing

[-] Some hiccups with loopage, causing a few output errors
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see a better way to repeat a program. Is there a
"goto" function in java? That would be way easier than putting the entire code
in a while loop.
