PROJECT TITLE: 5.05 Dice Probability
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate the use of the Random object
VERSION or DATE: November 21st, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to generate and use Random objects

[+] Loops are super easy to do now. There's just loops everywhere...
                               EVERYWHERE!

[-] Trying to figure out a way to output data for every possible input of
dice sides, dice amounts, and rolls took a really long time to figure out was
going to take too long (aprx. 2 hours before I realized it)

[-] It would be nice if the demands in the rubric were possible with the given
information (as in I don't have to do something extra, outside of the guidelines)
===============================================================================
In the future, I probably won't overestimate my abilities in programming to do
something a bit more extreme than the assignment asks. I would like to know,
though, is it possible to create more variables implicitly through programming,
or do all variable declarations have to be explicit?
(ex.: Can I create a loop that generates variables with the name integer[x],
where x is a number, and just have those variables to input data?)

The probability of a dice combination being rolled is static.
