In the future, I would REALLY like it if I could've started from scratch; I get
why they can't always have it be freely made, but I think it should mostly be 
uniquely created. Gets the brain learning, or whatever...
If there are static methods, are there moving/antistatic methods? What do THEY
do? Do we learn about them?
