PROJECT TITLE: 7.04 Defining New Methods
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To better understand how methods are used
VERSION or DATE: December 8th, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to make and use methods

[-] The program instructions sort of force you to use methods, even when they
might not be appropriate... I know it's trying to get practice making methods,
but it should practice it in a practical sense. I mean, come on! Using a 
seperate method to output the data? That's just silly.

[-] This was not a fun program. Mostly because I finished with the program,
looked at the rubric, and found out that it required some useless methods. I
had to spend about an hour rewriting the program.
===============================================================================
In the future, I'd like to be able to have control over how the program layout
is. Like, not every little action requiring methods.
