==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Able to use methods with everything else I've learned

[+] This was kind of pleasant to do - something relaxing, I guess

[-] A bit short

[-] Decided to input 1,000,000,000 for how many darts there were... took around
15 minutes to get the approximation. Even then, the approximation was only
accurate to the thrid or fourth decimal. To get a super accurate approximation,
you would have to run the simulation forever.
===============================================================================
In the future, I'd like the challenge programs to be more of a challenge, and
less of a refresher on the past topics. Of course, that's just me being nit-
picky :P
