PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand the usage of the Math class methods
VERSION or DATE: November 27th, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use the Math class methods

[+] I like adding more things to the project to make them somewhat harder;
for instance, user input.

[-] A little too easy

[-] Had to bug fix the program from printing -0.000 to the screen
===============================================================================
In the future, I think I would enjoy using more of the Math class methods. I
would like to know though, is module 7 the module where we learn how to create
methods inside of classes to be used inside of other classes (like with the
Math class)?
