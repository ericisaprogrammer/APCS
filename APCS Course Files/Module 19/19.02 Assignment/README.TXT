==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand RuntimeExceptions, Assertions, and how to test them

[+] When I was testing the RuntimeExceptions, I was 100% sure that there would
be nothing wrong, but it actually helped me find an error, which I thought was
funny.
===============================================================================
In the future, I think I will be implementing RuntimeExceptions more often,
because they are actually pretty useful.
