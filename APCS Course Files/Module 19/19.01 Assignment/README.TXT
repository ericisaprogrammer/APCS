AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use RuntimeExceptions

[+] Looking forward to learning more exceptions (Exception: They suck.)
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to know how many types of exceptions there are. I
probably will never need to use most of them, but it would still be neat to
know.
