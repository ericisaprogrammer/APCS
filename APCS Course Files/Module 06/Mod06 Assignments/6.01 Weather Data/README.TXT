==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to utilize single and double dimension arrays

[+] I enjoyed making my own challenge to this assignment

[+] Formatting doubles is no longer a hassal :D

[-] Adding the information for each city was tedious, but that's mostly my fault

[-] Kind of easy, but that's to be expected from a section 2 assignment

[-] Formatting might have looked nicer, but it's not nicer to work with (right
now, anyways. Maybe in the future, though...)
===============================================================================
In the future, I think I could add more challenges to the program requirements
to spice things up a bit. I would also like to know if there are three dimensional
arrays. If there are, does that mean there's 4th dimensional arrays? 5th? How
many dimensions of arrays am I allowed?
