AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use and implement replacement algorithms

[+] After the craziness of the past few modules, it feels kinda relieving to
have a few easier assignments

[-] It's a bit too easy at the moment, but that's not too bad...
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to see what these assignments are leading up to.
