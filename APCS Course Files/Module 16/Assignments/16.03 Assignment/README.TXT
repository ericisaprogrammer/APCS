PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate insertion algorithms

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use insertion algorithms

[-] I get that I have to know how to use both array and ArrayList algorithms,
but it does not make sense to have regular array insertion methods, since you
always lose data.
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to know where these algorithms are going; seems like it
is building towards something (perhaps in the challenge program?).
