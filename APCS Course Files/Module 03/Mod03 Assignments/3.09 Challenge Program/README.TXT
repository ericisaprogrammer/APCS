AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Successfully able to think through the problem and write pseudocode to 
formulate a solution

[+] Organization has gotten better, and mistakes are down to a minimum

[-] Overthought the problem, extending the duration of creation

[-] Importing and creating objects is still kind of confusing
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope that it will be easier to access a set of values (arrays)
instead of having to use an "improvised" array, such as the one in this program.
I had a lot of fun making this program!
