PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand the use of Escape Sequences and ASCII Art
VERSION or DATE: 09/8/2015 
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the usage of Escape Sequences

[+] Know how to utilize escape sequences in programs, such as with ASCII art

[-] ASCII art is pretty tedious, and requires patience, which leads to a
result that vaguely looks like what you want it to be
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope that I can use this knowledge in some form or another,
because it seems like this might not have that many uses, outside of printing
commands.
