PROJECT TITLE: 3.06 Strings
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand the usage String class methods
VERSION or DATE: 09/16/2015 
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the usage of the String classes shown

[+] Escape sequences were used  seamlessly with String variables to format it
and make it pretty

[-] Replacing a word doesn't account for words that have VaRiAtIoNs in
capitalization, making the process kind of tedious and unnecessary
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope that I will learn how to replace letters regardless of
format. Is there a way to replace multiple letters/words with one line of code?
