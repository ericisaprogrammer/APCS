==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how merge sort works

[+] It was a little confusing at first, but it was fun to learn how it works.

[-] Merge sort took a lot to understand
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to know how to do more sorts. I personally went
into more sorts, such as Radix, Quick, and Heap sort. They all look really cool!
