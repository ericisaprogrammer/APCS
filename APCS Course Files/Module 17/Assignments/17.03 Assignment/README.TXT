VERSION or DATE: May 2nd, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand selection sort

[+] This sort is really simple to get a grasp of, and will probably be my
go-to sort for small projects, since it's so easy to write

[-] This method of sorting is really inefficient for computing, but really
efficient for programmers. This is a dilema. I don't like dilemas.
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to know exactly how to calculate the speed of a
sort. When browing the web, I came across something called "O notation;" will
I come across this later in the course, or is this a college topic?
