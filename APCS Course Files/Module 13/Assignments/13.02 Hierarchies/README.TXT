PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate how class hierarchies work
VERSION or DATE: March 22nd, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the basic principals of class hierarchies

[+] Even though the task was simple, I can see how class hierarchies and
polymorphism can save a tremendous amount of time and energy, which is huge
considering how early into it I am.

[-] Although polymorphism and class hierarchies are very important in OOP, I
still have to get used to the logic behind them. For instance, I would have
liked to have just one method to display the land info, .info(), instead of
having three seperate ones (e.g. .forestInfo(), .mountainInfo()).
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope to see sprawling hierarchy trees that are interwoven
in a complicated web of polymorphism. It seems like it would look pretty cool.
