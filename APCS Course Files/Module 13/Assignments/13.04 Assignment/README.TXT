PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand how to override methods in subclasses
VERSION or DATE: March 24th, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to override methods

[+] Now that I know all of these tools to build webs of objects affecting
one another, I feel like I have a better grasp on how it all works.

[-] Overriding seems like it's just a way to make life easier by saving name
space. It doesn't seem like there's a huge use for it outside of overriding
the toString() and equals() methods.
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see something like this in practical applications.
Is there a better use for overriding other than making life slightly easier
by making methods easy to remember (besides customizing methods for subclasses)?
