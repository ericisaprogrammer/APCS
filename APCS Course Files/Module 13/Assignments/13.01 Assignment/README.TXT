PROJECT TITLE: 13.01 Assignment
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate the basic principals of inheritance
VERSION or DATE: March 21st, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the basic principals of inheritance

[+] Even though the information learned here was basic, I am already thinking
of ways to implement it into past and future projects to make them work better

[-] Coming up with negative aspects of this project was hard, because it was
relatively short and not very easy to actively "hate"
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to be able to use this in tandem with some bigger
projects, such as building a tree of objects that are interwoven together, like
geometric shapes or plants or something else.
