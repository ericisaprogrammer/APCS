PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate the applications of Polymorphism

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the basic principals of Polymorphism

[+] When I first played around with the getClass() and getName() methods to
create methods that can discern between sub/superclasses, I felt like I had
learned something important

[-] Using Polymorphism to print the locations of circles feels like using a
nuke to kill a moth... like I was using something with far more uses than just
what I used it for.
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to see greater application of Polymorphism, since it's
one of those big things you hear about in OOP... Hopefully it has a wider
utility than just printing out the locations of circles :P.
