==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Better understand interfaces and abtract classes

[+] I like implementing random elements to these assignments

[-] I can't think of a negative point.
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to implement more random elements. It feels like this
would be more practical to test programs, since it more closely mimics real
life circumstances.
