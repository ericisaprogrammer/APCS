==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand basic recursion methods

[+] It felt kinda cool to go back into the old format of programming and sort
of feeling how it felt again. Even though it has only been a few months, it 
feels very different.

[-] For the output, I expected a more diverse data set. Of course, I guess this
demonstrates that recursion needs a bit of variety in its input.
===============================================================================
In the future, I'd like to see the practical applications of recursion. I have
a feeling that is going to be very soon...
