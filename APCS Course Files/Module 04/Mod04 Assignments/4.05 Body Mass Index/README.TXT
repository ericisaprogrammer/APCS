==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Trying to figure out how to round a decimal to the nearest tenth was fun!

[+] I didn't have to look at any of the notes to remember how to do things!
Yay!

[-] The code to round the numbers is quite cumbersome. I with there was a way
to cut back on the code footprint...
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope that there would be a way to perform repeated actions to
a variable without copying and pasting code. Is there a way to make a custom
object with its own properties?
