PROJECT TITLE: 4.03 Heart Rate Target Zone
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To understand the use of if statements and how they work
VERSION or DATE: 10/20/2015 
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand if statements (form and function)

[+] Understanding of creating diverging code

[-] if statements are only really useful for a fork-in-the-code type situation,
not for something bigger (e.g. choosing options from a menu)

[-] if statements seem to be too small to be "really" useful
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to know what else if statements can be used for. Can they
be used for something bigger and better?

Probably.
