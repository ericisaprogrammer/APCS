AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the purpose of if/else statements

[+] Understand how to utilize if/else statements when processing inputs

[-] Writing out the scanner object declaration required looking at notes

[-] Slight bug issue, where the numbers were not displaying decimals to the
first place

better, more complex programs.
