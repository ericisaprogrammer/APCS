==================================PMR==========================================
[+] The practice was nice to review the topics previously learned

[+] Whenever the topic of learning programming comes up, there's always talk of
a prime number generator. Since the beginning of this course, I have been 
tinkering around with one and trying to make it better, more efficient, and 
more versatile.

[-] Since I have already been tinkering around with a prime number generator,
the assignment was a little easy.
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to continue working on a prime number generator,
making it better and better.
