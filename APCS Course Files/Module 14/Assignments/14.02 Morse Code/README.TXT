PROJECT TITLE: 14.02 Morse Code
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate the applications of static methods
VERSION or DATE: March 28th, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use static methods outside of a class

[+] Going back and using static methods sheds a new light on the subject and
creates a sort of "loop" or "web" that makes OOP seem that much more complex
and elegant

[-] It felt like the scanners for Files were not needed in this project - it
just felt unnecessary (unless it was for review, in which case - nevermind.)
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see more projects like this, where we go back
to an already learned topic and expand upon it to understand it better and use
it to its full potential. It's pretty cool to be able to see these older things
being reused and reintroduced to suit a better purpose.
