AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the proper usage of this

[+] The keyword this - even though it isn't needed - makes the programs feel
more professional.

[-] ...Really? "this" needed an assignment?
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see a few more things like this that don't
necesarily need to be known, but make the entire program more polished.
