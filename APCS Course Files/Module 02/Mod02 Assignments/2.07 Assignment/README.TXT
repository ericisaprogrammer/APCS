AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

===============================================PMR================================================
[+] Know how to use the shortcuts shown in the lessons to create a better program

[+] The shortcuts used in this assignment were intuitive, easy to use, and very useful

[-] Copying and pasting lines of code to get a repeating action is dull and tedious

[-] The way that the assignment instructions want a specific output format is kind of restrictive;
Would be more enjoyable if I could make my own format
===============================================PMR================================================
I had to learn the hard way to read through the entire instructions before beginning, because
I proceeded to make my own output format without reading the assignment instructions. I also
learned the hard way to compile the program along the way, because I copied a set of code and it 
had a few syntax errors, which was then multiplied by 8, because I didn't compile first.
