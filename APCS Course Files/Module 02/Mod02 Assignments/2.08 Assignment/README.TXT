==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Learned to compile before continuing on with coding

[+] Converting values to different values is second nature

[-] Still forgetting to add the semicolon to the end of some assignments

[-] Casting still seems like a foreign concept

In the future, compiling the program throughout the coding process will
help continuously with projects and such.
