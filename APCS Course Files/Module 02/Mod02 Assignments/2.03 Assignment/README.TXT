*----------------PMR-----------------*
[+]Using variables allows for a more
flexible program

[+]Typing out print statements are
now second nature, thanks to the
repetition

[-]The process of completely removing
all integers and replacing them with
variables is tedious and boring
*------------------------------------*
I learned that when an integer is divided by an integer,
the result will be an integer, regardless of the correct
answer (ex. 4/5 is .8, but it will output 0). I wonder
what happens when you mix data types... Does the data
type with the most data get transfered to the answer?
Does the program crash? Does the Stock Market fall?
These are questions I hope will be answered soon.
