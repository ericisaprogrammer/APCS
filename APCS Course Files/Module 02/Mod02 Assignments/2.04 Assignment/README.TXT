[-----------------------PMR---------------------------]

[+]Typing out System.out.print(ln)(); now comes second
nature.

[+]Understanding of how double and int variables
interact with each other.

[-]Typographical errors are still present throughout
writing.

[-]Replacing all of the numbers with variables was
time consuming and boring.
[-----------------------------------------------------]
In the future: It would probably help writing down
which variables contain what values on a note card or
piece of paper to save time.
