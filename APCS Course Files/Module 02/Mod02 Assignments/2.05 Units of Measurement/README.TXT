VERSION or DATE: 08/25/15
AUTHORS: Eric Osgood
***********************************PMR*********************************************************

[+] Gained a better understanding of how variables can be used in arithmetic expressions

[+] Syntax mistakes are minimal and minor

[-] It appears that Java will not be that easy of a language to write in;
There is a lot that needs to be taken into account to properly run a program.

[-] There are still simple mistakes printing string literals with variables
************************************************************************************************
In the future: Pay closer attention to the string literals being printed, as to avoid syntax
errors.
