==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use object arrays

[+] Creating and manipulating data using objects is second nature

[-] Some of the manipulations of data (such as the output) seem a little clunky
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to see what else I could do with object arrays.
I feel like there are a few more properties that they have that might be useful.
