PROJECT TITLE: 8.03 Default Constructors
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To gain experience in using simple objects
VERSION or DATE: December 26th, 2015
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to utilize the default constructor and use new objects using
said constructor

[-] Didn't particularly enjoy this assignment, but that's just because it felt
tedious to do this small program with objects. I know that will change pretty
soon, but still...
===============================================================================
In the future, I'd like to see how objects can be used to do more interesting
things, like, I don't know... video games?
