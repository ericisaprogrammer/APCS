AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Have a basic understanding of Javadoc formatting

[+] Being able to see the program in an official document felt kinda good

[-] Javadoc formatting is going to take a while to get used to
===============================================================================
In the future, I would expect there to be more Javadoc commands to be implemented,
such as formatting commands found in the printf() command.
