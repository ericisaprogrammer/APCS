VERSION or DATE: January 23rd, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use multiple objects and classes to organize and output
data

[+] Understand the benefits of using OOP

[-] There were some errors that came up when copy/pasting code, such as
variables not matching up. But thanks to OOP, it was easy to fix, like I would
see a problem in the output and think "Oh, this must be wrong," because
I knew where everything was since it was so organized. I guess that's more
of a plus than a minus, but whatever.
===============================================================================
In the future, I would like to continue separating my output and object code,
since it is so beneficial to do so.
When I said "I finally feel like I'm programming," I meant that everything
previous here had a feeling like "I could just do this by hand and it would be
faster," but these last few projects felt like it needed to be done in code.
And that's a pretty good feeling, to be honest.
