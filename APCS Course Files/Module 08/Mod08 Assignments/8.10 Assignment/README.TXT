PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Demonstrate the advantages of ArrayLists and their abilities
VERSION or DATE: 02/02/2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand the basics of ArrayLists

[+] Before this, I didn't know you could use objects in constructors. It caught
me by surprise and I think that's pretty cool.

[-] Javadoc documentation is still kinda over my head
===============================================================================
In the future, I want to create an object trail, as in the object constructor
you end with requires an object whose constructor requires an object whose
constructor requires an object whose constructor requires an object. Would this
have practical applications? Probably.
