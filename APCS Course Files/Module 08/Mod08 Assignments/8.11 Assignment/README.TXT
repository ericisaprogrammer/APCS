==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Material in module 8 is understood

[+] Compared to the other challenge programs, this one is sorta low on the
tedium list

[-] Javadocs is still kinda out there, but getting better

[-] Some of the information for this project is outdated, such as the pounds of
CO2 produced per KWH and gallon of gas

[-] Formatting is stupid.
