VERSION or DATE: January 26th, 2016
AUTHOR: Eric Osgood

==================================PMR==========================================
[+] Understand how to use constructors and private variables with methods and
classes

[+] This was probably one of the few times where I felt like I was acctually
programming, instead of just writing out the code explicitly. It's a good
feeling.

[-] Some of the output statements were a bit of a hassle to format correctly.

[-] Using the object's methods in the formatting output felt clunky.
===============================================================================
In the future, I hope to see what else I can do with objects.
It's good to be back :)
